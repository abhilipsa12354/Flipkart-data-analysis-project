# Flipkart-data-analysis-project
Key Analysis Performed

The following analyses I carried out in the project:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Converted data types (price, ratings, discounts)

Standardized column names for easier analysis

2. Product & Category Analysis

Identified top-selling categories and sub-categories

Compared average price and ratings across categories

Found products with high demand but low ratings
3. Price & Discount Analysis

Analyzed the relationship between price, discount, and sales

Identified discount ranges that attract more customers

Compared original price vs discounted price impact

4. Customer Rating Analysis

Distribution of product ratings

Relationship between ratings and number of reviews

Identification of highly rated but less visible products

5. Visualization & Insights

Bar charts for category-wise sales

Line charts for pricing trends

Heatmaps to understand correlation between features

Clear visual storytelling using graphs
Tools & Technologies Used

Python – core programming language

Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – numerical computations

Matplotlib – basic visualizations

Seaborn – advanced statistical visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis environment
Key Business Insights

Certain categories contribute a major portion of total sales

Higher discounts generally increase sales but reduce profit margins

Products with good ratings but low visibility represent growth opportunities

Customer ratings strongly influence purchasing decisions
